# T3 TypeScript, Tailwind & tRPC Example

Did not complete this code because the code in video
it is base on is different than the latest auto created
code with the command
`yarn create t3app`.
The client hangs due to frequently repetitively trying
to connect to sever.
Could only progress so far by disabling the client in
\_app.tsx and now have errors.
So I gave up with 10 minutes left in the tutorial at 34m37s in.

## Creation History

```bash
yarn create t3-app
yarn add ws nanoid node-fetch
yarn add @types/ws npm-run-all @types/cookie ts-node-dev dotenv -D
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

## Code History

The code in this repository is based on the
[Build a Live Chat Application with the T3 Stack](https://youtu.be/dXRRY37MPuk)
video.
